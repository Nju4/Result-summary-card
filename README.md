## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learned a lot from this project especially about the grid, then responsive design which I still figure it out how the other functions, I also had a little trouble making cards but I'm pretty good at it, more complex css box functions, etc.

### Continued development

For me, there are some things that I want to continue to work on from my experience making this project to practice making more grids and flexboxes and then, how to build something to look neat using css and html.
